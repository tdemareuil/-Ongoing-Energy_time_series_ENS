# -Ongoing-Energy_time_series_ENS

This is the final project for my Machine Learning (II) class at Ecole Polytechnique (MSc Data Science, 2019-2020).

The goal is to train an algorithm to replace usual house energy consumption monitoring systems which are too intrusive and too expensive. This challenge is known as NILM (Nonintrusive load monitoring) or NIALM (Nonintrusive appliance load monitoring). The aim of the challenge is to predict the proportion of electric consumption in one household dedicated to 4 appliances (washing machine, fridge_freezer, TV, kettle) based on time data.

This challenge is provided by ENS (Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure): https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/29/.
